>The SPX dropped 5% last Thursday and 6% on Friday. Today is Sunday. The first image shows the SPX 4h chart, which is in strong oversold condition according to the RSI. however, the second image shows the SPX weekly chart, and there is still room to go lower. The third image shows the VIX, which went all the way to 45 in Friday, which was a 50,93% increase over Thursday (where it stopped at 30). My estimate was that the retail investors will want to sell their stocks early monday, leading into a further decline, maybe to the resistance level of 4960, but then it should - for the short term of a few days - bounce back to remove the oversold condition, until it declines further (underlying market conditions are really bad currently and I do not see strong indicators to feather the fall). However, I am also afraid of the falling-knife-pattern as well as the Black Monday Event from 1987. There is also news that came out, that hedge funds got margin called on Friday, which led to the -6% that we can see in the charts. Explore the likelihoods on how the SPX might develop and try to give some estimations (for example 20% black Monday event, 80% v-shape on Monday). Use all your knowledge on the open market that you have. Be as extensive in your exploration and explanation as possible.

To accurately explore likely SPX development scenarios, could you clarify a few points?

1. What is your intended time horizon for this analysis? (e.g., just the next few trading days, the next 2–3 weeks, or longer?)
2. Are you looking for probabilities on multiple potential short-term outcomes (like rebound, further crash, dead cat bounce), or just a primary expected scenario?
3. Do you want me to factor in macroeconomic data and geopolitical news (e.g., Trump tariff conflict with China) alongside technicals?
Once I have that, I’ll proceed with the full breakdown and probability estimates.

>I only care for the next 2-3 weeks time horizon. I am convinced that the long-term is a downward-trend (according to the SPX weekly MACD). I am looking for the probabilities on multiple potential short-term outcomes (like rebound, further crash, dead cat bounce). I want you to factor in macroeconomic data alongside the technicals.

# Short-Term S&P 500 Outlook: Trade War Shock and Volatility Surge

## Market Overview & Technical Analysis

The S&P 500 just suffered its worst week since the 2020 pandemic crash, plunging nearly 7% over the last five sessions amid escalating U.S.–China trade tensions [businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-recession-outlook-trump-tariffs-sp500-wall-street-2025-4#:~:text=The%20trade%20war%20crushed%20stocks,this%20week). A **volatility shock** accompanied the drop – the CBOE VIX “fear index” spiked as high as 45 (its highest since 2020), a **51% one-day jump** signaling extreme investor anxiety​ [blockchain.news](https://blockchain.news/flashnews/vix-index-hits-45-and-declines-by-10-points-amid-market-volatility#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Kobeissi%20Letter%2C,trading%20strategies%20and%20market%20positioning) [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vix-closes-highest-since-2020-202502849.html#:~:text=Accelerates%20finance,31%2C%20a). This sell-off was broad-based: major indices fell into correction or bear-market territory (the Nasdaq-100 is down over 20% from its peak)​[businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-recession-outlook-trump-tariffs-sp500-wall-street-2025-4#:~:text=The%20trade%20war%20crushed%20stocks,this%20week), and safe-haven flows pushed Treasury yields to multi-month lows​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=,at%20Monex%20USA%20in%20Washington). Importantly, news broke on April 4 of **large hedge fund margin calls**, as banks demanded extra collateral after the plunge – the biggest wave of margin calls since the March 2020 crash​[lawyer-monthly.com](https://www.lawyer-monthly.com/2025/04/hedge-funds-margin-calls-tariff-crash72961/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20are%20facing%20Lehman,of%20a%20looming%20%27Black%20Monday)[lawyer-monthly.com](https://www.lawyer-monthly.com/2025/04/hedge-funds-margin-calls-tariff-crash72961/#:~:text=In%20the%20wake%20of%20Trump%27s,bullion%20to%20offset%20their%20losses). This combination of **technical breakdown**, **surging volatility**, and **forced deleveraging** provides the backdrop for the coming 2–3 weeks.

**Multi-timeframe technicals** confirm a market in extreme stress. On the **4-hour chart**, the index collapsed through short-term support levels, and momentum indicators are deeply oversold. **RSI** on the 4h is languishing in the teens (well below the typical oversold threshold of 30), and the **stochastic RSI** is near zero – a reflection of panic-selling intensity​[investing.com](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-technical#:~:text=Investing,MACD%2812%2C26%29). **MACD** on this timeframe has a steep negative histogram, underscoring strong downward momentum. Price also sliced below its lower **Bollinger Band**, an uncommon move suggesting an overshoot to the downside​[investing.com](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-technical#:~:text=Investing,MACD%2812%2C26%29). These signals indicate a market stretched far below equilibrium in the short run.

_Figure: S&P 500 index, 4-hour chart. A sharp breakdown in early April pushed RSI into oversold territory and drove price below the lower Bollinger Band (indicating an extreme deviation from recent averages). Key short-term support levels failed as stop-loss selling and margin liquidations accelerated the decline._

On a **weekly chart (long-term)**, the damage is likewise significant. The **14-week RSI** has fallen into oversold territory (below 30) for the first time since the March 2020 COVID crash​ [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oversold-conditions-grant-mega-buying-152852635.html#:~:text=Oversold%20Conditions%20Grant%20a%20Mega,rarely%20spends%20time%20as%20oversold), highlighting how rare and severe this move is. The last time the S&P’s weekly momentum was this washed-out, it marked the bottom of the pandemic sell-off and preceded a strong rebound​ [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oversold-conditions-grant-mega-buying-152852635.html#:~:text=Oversold%20Conditions%20Grant%20a%20Mega,rarely%20spends%20time%20as%20oversold) . The index also **violated major support**: it sliced decisively below its 40-week (~200-day) moving average (around 5,760)​[finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-500-pushed-breaking-point-133600933.html#:~:text=Stocks%20finance,The%20index%20snapped%20a), a long-term trend gauge that it had held above for most of the past year. This is a bearish signal – sustained trades below the 200-day MA often denote a trend regime change to the downside​ [forexlive.com](https://www.forexlive.com/technical-analysis/sp-index-moving-closer-to-its-rising-200-day-moving-average-20250306/#:~:text=The%20200,levels%20the%20next%20likely%20targets). In addition, the weekly candle closed well under a prior support zone (the late-2024 highs), suggesting bulls failed to defend a key line in the sand. Overall, the technical breakdown across multiple timeframes implies that without an external positive catalyst, the **path of least resistance** may remain downward in the near term.

## Volatility & Sentiment Signals

The volatility spike provides additional context for probable scenarios. The **VIX finishing in the mid-40s** indicates a level of fear and hedging demand not seen in years​ [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vix-closes-highest-since-2020-202502849.html#:~:text=Accelerates%20finance,31%2C%20a) . In fact, put option activity exploded amid the rout – **total put volume hit a record high** as investors scrambled for downside protection​ [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vix-closes-highest-since-2020-202502849.html#:~:text=Accelerates%20finance,31%2C%20a). This rush to buy puts and volatility insurance is characteristic of **capitulation**-like episodes. Often, such extreme moves in the VIX are **contrarian indicators** that fear is near a peak – a necessary ingredient for a relief bounce. However, volatility markets also hint at ongoing turmoil: the term structure of VIX futures likely inverted (short-term vol higher than long-term), reflecting immediate stress. Traders will be watching if the VIX can quickly retreat or if it remains elevated above 30–40; an **elevated VIX** for an extended period would signal **persistent risk-off sentiment** and potentially more downside​ [home.saxo](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/macro/market-quick-take---4-april-2025-04042025#:~:text=The%20VIX%20surged%2039.56,VX1%29%20held%20steady%2C%20intraday).

It’s also notable that **liquidity strains** are emerging. As mentioned, **margin calls** are forcing leveraged players to liquidate holdings. Prime brokers reportedly held emergency meetings as of Friday to manage the surge in margin calls, the largest since early 2020​ [lawyer-monthly.com](https://www.lawyer-monthly.com/2025/04/hedge-funds-margin-calls-tariff-crash72961/#:~:text=engaging%20with%20clients%20to%20evaluate,risk%20across%20their%20entire%20portfolios). According to insider reports, hedge funds and leveraged ETFs dumped over $40 billion in stocks at a breakneck pace late in the week​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=Global%20hedge%20funds%20and%20levered,notes%20to%20clients%20on%20Friday). **Volatility-targeting funds** (which adjust exposure based on market volatility) may have another ~$25–30 billion in equities to sell **in coming days** to reduce risk, JPMorgan warned​ [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=JP%20Morgan%20said%20in%20a,unwind%20positions%20to%20reduce%20risk). This kind of automatic, flow-driven selling can exacerbate a downturn. Unless volatility rapidly subsides, these systematic strategies will keep unloading stocks, which could limit the extent of any near-term bounces. In sum, sentiment is fearful and **market internals are stretched**, but the reflexivity of volatility and forced selling will shape whether we see further cascade or a snap-back rally.

Against this backdrop, we outline several plausible short-term scenarios for the S&P 500 over the next 2–3 weeks. For each scenario, we assess the likelihood and draw comparisons to historical episodes (e.g. the 1987 crash, 2008 deleveraging, 2020 pandemic sell-off) to inform probability estimates.

## Scenario 1: **Crash Continuation (“Black Monday”-style)**

**Description:** In this bearish scenario, the market free-fall continues at the start of the week, with another **sharp collapse (10%+)** in a day or two – akin to a modern “Black Monday.” The combination of **margin call liquidations, volatility-driven fund deleveraging, and panic selling** could snowball into another leg down. Over the weekend, hedge funds facing huge losses might fail to meet margin requirements, prompting forced liquidation of positions when markets open. The S&P could gap down violently on Monday and trigger exchange **circuit breakers** (which trip after a 7% intraday drop)​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=said%20Jeff%20O%27Connor%2C%20head%20of,market%20structure%20at%20Liquidnet). This scenario would extend the crash in a straight line, perhaps pushing the index well into bear market territory (>20% down from the highs) in short order.

**Evidence & Drivers:** Current market elements unfortunately echo some precursors to the October 1987 crash. Then, as now, **portfolio insurance/program trading** (today’s analogue would be vol-targeting funds and algorithmic stop-loss orders) can create a self-reinforcing selloff. Notably, **Friday’s 6% plunge** brought the S&P _within a hair_ of a trading halt​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=said%20Jeff%20O%27Connor%2C%20head%20of,market%20structure%20at%20Liquidnet), indicating how fragile liquidity has become. Banks report that hedge funds are facing “_Lehman-style_” margin calls​[lawyer-monthly.com](https://www.lawyer-monthly.com/2025/04/hedge-funds-margin-calls-tariff-crash72961/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20are%20facing%20Lehman,of%20a%20looming%20%27Black%20Monday)– a reference to the 2008 crisis when forced sales accelerated the downward spiral. If those margin calls are not met, additional **fire-sales** could hit early in the week, overwhelming buyers. JPMorgan’s estimate of $25–30 billion in imminent _volatility-triggered_ selling adds to this ominous setup​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=JP%20Morgan%20said%20in%20a,unwind%20positions%20to%20reduce%20risk). Furthermore, the news that **China retaliated forcefully** with tariffs has introduced a major **geopolitical shock** that could have unpredictable second-order effects (e.g. European markets and Asian markets plunging on Monday, feeding back into U.S. trading). In 1987’s Black Monday, a confluence of selling pressures and automation led the Dow to **-22.6% in one session**[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_\(1987\)#:~:text=,regarding%20%2098%20in%201988). While regulations and circuit breakers make a 20% single-day drop less likely today, a cascade of, say, two or three consecutive huge down days is conceivable if **fear hits a breaking point**.

Historical analogs underscore this scenario’s possibility albeit at low frequency. In **October 1987**, after a sizable decline the prior week, the bottom fell out on Monday as liquidity vanished – a scenario investors fear could replay (“_looming ‘Black Monday’_” has been mentioned by strategists)​[lawyer-monthly.com](https://www.lawyer-monthly.com/2025/04/hedge-funds-margin-calls-tariff-crash72961/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20are%20facing%20Lehman,of%20a%20looming%20%27Black%20Monday). In **late 2008**, once Lehman Brothers failed, global equities saw relentless selling for days, interrupted only by trading halts. Even **March 2020** saw multiple _limit-down_ overnight sessions and a -12% single-day plunge (Mar 16, 2020) when margin calls and COVID panic peaked. The current climate of spiking VIX and margin stress could similarly yield an **early-week capitulation**. If this occurs, the S&P might rapidly drop to major long-term support – for example, the ~4,500 area (near the 200-week moving average) could be tested within days if a full-blown crash unfolds.

**Mitigating Factors:** One note is that policymakers are alert; the **Fed and Treasury might step in** to stabilize markets if a free-fall develops. (In 1987, the Fed’s prompt liquidity assurances helped quell the crash after Black Monday​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_\(1987\)#:~:text=,regarding%20%2098%20in%201988)

.) There were already hints of action: Fed Chair Powell acknowledged the tariff shock could slow growth and indicated readiness to act if needed, and President Trump urged an emergency rate cut (“perfect time” for it)​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=Trump%27s%20new%20tariffs%20are%20,to%20do%20so). Such intervention prospects may reduce the probability of an unchecked crash continuation.

**Probability:** **~20%.** This is a **low-probability, worst-case** scenario. While not the base case, it cannot be dismissed given the extraordinary volatility and forced selling pressures in play. The odds of a _1987-style crash extension_ are perhaps on the order of 1 in 5 under current conditions – unlikely, but uncomfortably high by normal standards.

## Scenario 2: **Dead Cat Bounce (Temporary Rebound)**

**Description:** After the steep drop and extreme oversold readings, the market could stage a **technical relief rally** – the classic “dead cat bounce.” In this scenario, bargain hunters and short-covering drive the S&P 500 higher in the coming days, recouping a portion of last week’s losses. However, the rebound would likely be **short-lived**. It might last only a few sessions (or 1–2 weeks at most) before **fizzling out**, as fundamental selling pressure reasserts itself. Essentially, this would be a **bear market rally**: sharp and fast, but ultimately failing below previous highs, followed by a continuation of the downtrend. For example, the S&P might bounce on Monday/Tuesday by, say, +5% to +8% (e.g. back toward ~5700–5800, which was recent support turned resistance​[moneymorning.com](https://moneymorning.com/2025/03/17/dead-cat-bounce-alert-details-and-outlook/#:~:text=You%20should%20expect%20to%20see,day%20moving%20average)

), giving hope that the worst is over – only to **“roll over”** afterward if trade tensions and liquidity issues persist.

**Evidence & Drivers:** There are strong arguments that a relief rally is due **immediately** from a technical standpoint. **Oversold conditions** are extreme – the S&P’s daily RSI closed under 20, and the weekly RSI ~30 (a level rarely seen)​[finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oversold-conditions-grant-mega-buying-152852635.html#:~:text=Oversold%20Conditions%20Grant%20a%20Mega,rarely%20spends%20time%20as%20oversold). Historically, when the market gets this stretched to the downside, a reflexive bounce is common as sellers exhaust and opportunistic buyers step in. As one analysis noted, the S&P 500 has been oversold on a weekly basis only a handful of times in the past half-century, and in those instances the index _usually_ saw at least a short-term rally soon after​[finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oversold-conditions-grant-mega-buying-152852635.html#:~:text=Oversold%20Conditions%20Grant%20a%20Mega,rarely%20spends%20time%20as%20oversold). Another clue: the index closed far below its lower Bollinger Band, a 2-standard deviation move that often corrects by reverting back toward the mean. Also, **sentiment** is incredibly bearish now (e.g. put/call ratios at highs, VIX spiking) – often a contrarian signal that a bounce is near. This setup resembles past “washout” bottoms where an oversold rally emerges even amid a bear market.

Historical comparisons support the likelihood of a **dead cat bounce**. In **October 1987**, after Black Monday, the market _rebounded_ sharply the next two days (+5% and +9%) before sputtering again​[marketwatch.com](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-the-35th-anniversary-of-the-1987-stock-market-crash-what-investors-need-to-know-11666131409#:~:text=It%27s%20the%2035th%20anniversary%20of,following%20Monday%2C%20leaving%20it). In **late 2008**, there were violent bear-market rallies – e.g. the S&P surged ~19% over two days after Oct 2008’s initial plunge, and multiple 5–10% up-days occurred amidst the broader collapse. During the **2000–2002** dot-com bust and **2008** crisis, virtually every major downswing included periodic 1-2 week relief rallies of 5–15% that ultimately failed. Even in **March 2020**, the market had a couple of big up days (like +9% on March 13, 2020) in the middle of the crash, though they proved fleeting. These examples illustrate the typical bear market pattern: **oversold bounces** that _feel_ like a recovery but do not last as underlying issues persist.

If we get a bounce now, key levels to watch would be the **old support zones** and moving averages above. For instance, **5,700 on the S&P** – roughly the 200-day MA region and the bottom of the early-March consolidation – could act as resistance on a rebound​[moneymorning.com](https://moneymorning.com/2025/03/17/dead-cat-bounce-alert-details-and-outlook/#:~:text=You%20should%20expect%20to%20see,day%20moving%20average). Analysts at one trading firm noted the index might “trade as high as 5,700 before running into technical resistance” at the 200-day average​[moneymorning.com](https://moneymorning.com/2025/03/17/dead-cat-bounce-alert-details-and-outlook/#:~:text=You%20should%20expect%20to%20see,day%20moving%20average). A rally up near that area (around 5–8% above current levels) would relieve some oversold pressure, but unless there is concrete good news, it could stall out there. The macro backdrop (tariffs, margin deleveraging, recession fears) would likely cap the sustainability of any rally. Indeed, **fundamental sellers** (such as institutions reducing risk or vol funds rebalancing) may use a bounce as an opportunity to unload more stocks at slightly better prices, which could then resume downward pressure.

**Probability:** **~30%.** A short-term **technical rebound** is quite plausible – we assign roughly a one-in-three chance. This scenario may even be the _initial_ outcome (the market could bounce in the coming week) before another move lower. Many market participants expect some kind of “dead cat bounce” given how oversold conditions are, but the key is that it’s likely **temporary**. We view a reflex rally as a medium-probability event; however, its **failure afterward is also likely** unless the news backdrop materially improves. (In other words, Scenario 2 could morph into Scenario 4 – a bounce followed by renewed selling – which we address separately.)

## Scenario 3: **V-Shaped Recovery (Rapid Reversal to Pre-Crash Levels)**

**Description:** In this optimistic scenario, the S&P 500 would **bottom out quickly and roar back** to its pre-crisis levels (or higher) within the next 2–3 weeks. Essentially, the market would chart a **V-shaped recovery** – a sharp fall followed by an equally sharp rebound to the prior peak (~6150 on the index). This implies that the current sell-off, while violent, proves to be an isolated shock that is swiftly counteracted by policy responses or abates due to improving sentiment. The index would regain lost ground by late April, perhaps returning to the 6100s (erasing the tariff-crisis decline) and restoring the uptrend. Volatility would subside dramatically as fear ebbs and normal risk appetite resumes.

**Evidence & Drivers:** For a true V-shaped rebound to occur, typically a **powerful positive catalyst** is needed. One potential driver could be a sudden de-escalation in the trade war – for example, if negotiations resume and either President Trump or China signals a compromise or delay in tariff implementations. That would catch bearish traders off guard and likely ignite a relief rally. Another driver could be **monetary/fiscal intervention** strong enough to offset the trade shock. The Federal Reserve could step in with an emergency rate cut or liquidity injections (similar to what it did during past crises) to stabilize markets. In fact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments on Friday indicated the Fed is monitoring the situation, and President Trump explicitly called on the Fed to cut rates now​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=Trump%27s%20new%20tariffs%20are%20,to%20do%20so). If the Fed were to announce a surprise rate cut or bond-buying program in the coming days, it could spark a surge of buying. Likewise, global central banks or governments might coordinate to reassure investors (for instance, China could ease policy to support its economy, mitigating global fallout).

Historically, true V-shaped recoveries in the stock market are **rare** in such a short timeframe, but not without precedent. The **COVID-19 crash of 2020** is a notable example: after the S&P 500 crashed ~34% in February-March 2020, massive Fed intervention (rate cuts to 0%, trillions in QE) and fiscal stimulus ($2+ trillion CARES Act) led to a ferocious rebound – the index gained ~30% in two months and hit new highs by August 2020. However, even that “V” took about 5–6 months to fully regain the peak, not just weeks. A closer analogy in speed might be **the 2010 “Flash Crash”** (a one-day crash that reversed within days) or **2018’s volatility panic**: in February 2018, the S&P fell ~10% on a vol spike but recovered the bulk of the loss within about 3 weeks. Another reference is **1987**: after Black Monday, the Dow/S&P bounced and, with help from Fed liquidity assurances, largely stabilized; by year-end 1987, the market had recovered a significant portion of the crash (the Dow even finished 1987 slightly up for the year)​[marketwatch.com](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-you-can-learn-from-the-1987-stock-market-crash-2018-03-13#:~:text=What%20you%20can%20learn%20from,And). These instances show that with sufficient **policy backstop and improved sentiment**, rapid recoveries can occur even after a crash.

For the current situation, a V-shaped rebound would likely require that the **trade war fears prove overblown or get alleviated quickly**. Perhaps the markets could come to believe that Trump’s tariffs and China’s retaliation, while initially shocking, won’t escalate further – if, for example, backchannel talks emerge. It’s also possible that investors, flush with cash after the decline, start bargain-hunting en masse in big tech and other beaten-down sectors, fueling a momentum reversal. **Short-covering** by bearish traders could add fuel if key resistance levels (like 5800, 6000) are broken on the way back up, forcing many to chase the rally.

**Counterpoints:** Despite these possibilities, one must note that the **fundamental headwinds** (higher tariffs, earnings risks, rising recession odds) would remain even if the index bounced hard. It’s unlikely the market can simply shrug off the economic impact in a couple of weeks without concrete improvements. The **VIX at 45** suggests a lot of damage to confidence that usually takes time to repair. Thus, while a swift rebound is _possible_, it would likely be limited unless accompanied by real resolution of the underlying issues.

**Probability:** **~10%.** We assign a **low probability** to a full V-shaped recovery within weeks. It is the **least likely scenario** given the gravity of the macro catalyst and technical breakdown. Only if decisive good news or intervention emerges (e.g., Fed rate cut, trade truce) would this become more plausible. In effect, this scenario would require a near-miraculous alignment of positive developments to rapidly negate the recent shock. Barring that, the market is more likely to either bounce then falter or continue to consolidate at lower levels rather than immediately vault back to all-time highs.

## Scenario 4: **Consolidation Followed by Further Selling**

**Description:** In this scenario, the market does **not crash further immediately**, but also fails to mount a lasting recovery – instead it enters a brief period of **consolidation** (sideways or modestly higher trading) for days or a week or two, _before_ ultimately resuming its downtrend with another leg of selling. Essentially, the S&P 500 would stabilize in the short term – perhaps oscillating in a range (for example, bouncing between ~5400 and 5800) as bulls and bears tussle – but this calm would prove temporary. After digesting the initial shock (and perhaps after some key event like a Fed meeting or earnings reports), the **prevailing downtrend reasserts**, leading to further declines by the end of the 2–3 week horizon. This scenario is akin to a **“pause that refreshes”** the bear trend: the market works off extreme oversold conditions via time (going sideways) rather than a big upward reversal, and then selling pressure builds again, pushing the index to **lower lows** (potentially significantly below last week’s trough).

**Evidence & Drivers:** This outcome would align with the idea that **volatility remains elevated** and fundamental concerns persist, but that the market needs to consolidate short-term before the next drop. After an initial crash, markets often **enter a choppy trading range** as investors evaluate next steps. We have some early signs pointing to this: for instance, S&P futures showed a slight bounce after Friday’s close, suggesting that _immediate_ panic may abate as traders await further news (like upcoming economic data or Fed remarks)​[home.saxo](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/macro/market-quick-take---4-april-2025-04042025#:~:text=,3.7%25%2C%20marking%20the%20worst)

. Additionally, the huge surge in volatility might **mean-revert** a bit without a full rebound in stocks – implying a range-bound period. Importantly, **many institutional players are now de-risking**: as noted, hedge fund **net leverage** has dropped to an 18-month low due to the selling​[lawyer-monthly.com](https://www.lawyer-monthly.com/2025/04/hedge-funds-margin-calls-tariff-crash72961/#:~:text=exacerbated%20the%20situation,as%20reported%20by%20Morgan%20Stanley). This could lead to a temporary equilibrium where forced selling subsides (after the initial flurry of margin calls is handled), but **new buyers remain hesitant** given the macro uncertainty. In such a stalemate, the index might **stall** near a mid-point (perhaps ~5600–5700) – not plunging, but unable to rally strongly either.

The **macroeconomic catalyst** (tariffs and retaliation) is ongoing and potentially escalatory, which supports the notion that after a brief lull, more bad news could strike. For example, if no progress is made diplomatically, investors could grow more worried about earnings hits and **recession risk** (which is already rising​[businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-recession-outlook-trump-tariffs-sp500-wall-street-2025-4#:~:text=Image%3A%20Photo%20collage%20of%20recession,related%20imagery)). We are also heading into corporate earnings season (mid-April), where cautious outlooks or negative impacts from tariffs could be announced, possibly triggering another sell-off after an initial consolidation. Furthermore, **credit markets** and other indicators are starting to show stress (e.g. widening high-yield spreads to the highest since 2023​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=fixed%20income%20strategist%20at%20the,Financial%20Research%20in%20New%20York)). Such financial tightening often precedes equity downturns in a **lagged fashion** – meaning the real economic concerns might translate to a second wave of equity selling after a brief delay.

Historically, this **pattern of consolidation then deeper decline** has been seen in protracted sell-offs. In the **2008 financial crisis**, there were periods where stocks moved sideways or rebounded mildly for a few weeks (for instance, May–August 2008 saw a range after the Bear Stearns crisis) before the situation deteriorated again in the fall. After the initial **Oct 2008 crash**, stocks actually rallied and moved sideways for a couple of weeks before November brought new lows. Similarly, in the **dot-com bust**, after the sharp drop in April 2000, the market traded in a range through May–July, then fell further in the second half of 2000. Even in **2020**, one could argue there was a brief pause in early March between waves of selling. These analogues suggest that markets often _digest_ large declines (especially when triggered by systemic fears) with a period of consolidation, but if the underlying problem isn’t resolved, a **continuation of the downtrend** ensues.

In the present case, **volatility** is expected to remain high for some time – “investors do not expect volatility to subside quickly,” noted one strategist Friday​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=Investors%20do%20not%20expect%20volatility,to%20subside%20quickly)– which is consistent with a market that could remain unsettled and prone to further downside. As Schwab’s chief strategist observed, _until there’s a change in policy or clear progress on trade, the market will remain under pressure_​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=Investors%20do%20not%20expect%20volatility,to%20subside%20quickly). This encapsulates Scenario 4: **no immediate new policy relief**, some short-term stability, then continued pressure causing another sell-off. The next leg down could be triggered by a specific event (e.g. a **weak earnings guidance from major companies reflecting tariffs**, or further hedge fund woes) or simply by the realization that valuations need to adjust to a higher-risk environment. Technically, if the S&P cannot regain its 200-day moving average (~5760) from below, it will invite more sellers. A consolidation below that level could form a bearish continuation pattern (like a bear flag) – and once the range breaks, the index could swiftly retest last week’s low (~5500) and potentially fall to a deeper support (e.g. the **10% correction mark around 5535, or even 5400** which might be a Fibonacci retracement level or prior pivot).

**Probability:** **~40%.** We assign the **highest probability to this scenario**, as it represents a middle-ground expectation of how bear markets often play out. The market may stabilize briefly (especially if oversold technicals provoke some buying or if no new “shoes drop” immediately), but given the unresolved catalysts (trade war, margin deleveraging, recession risk), a **resumption of selling** is more likely than a full recovery. In essence, this scenario is a combination of Scenario 2 (short-term pause/bounce) _leading into_ renewed decline. Many institutional commentators are effectively expecting something like this: a period of consolidation/hesitation followed by further downside unless policy makers change course​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=Investors%20do%20not%20expect%20volatility,to%20subside%20quickly). We view a modest bounce or sideways drift in the very near term as likely, but ultimately, without positive developments, the path would turn lower again – making a lower low in the coming weeks quite plausible. Thus, roughly a 40% chance for consolidation then another sell-off, making it our **base-case scenario** under current conditions.

## Historical Context & Final Thoughts

To summarize, the market’s short-term trajectory is being pulled by competing forces of **extreme oversold technicals** (arguing for a bounce or at least a pause) versus **severe fundamental stress** (arguing the decline may have further to go). Our probability-weighted view favors a temporary stabilization (or rebound) followed by renewed selling (Scenario 4 as most likely, ~40% chance). A straight-line further crash (Scenario 1, ~20%) is less likely but cannot be ruled out if margin liquidations snowball before any support arrives​[lawyer-monthly.com](https://www.lawyer-monthly.com/2025/04/hedge-funds-margin-calls-tariff-crash72961/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20are%20facing%20Lehman,of%20a%20looming%20%27Black%20Monday) [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=JP%20Morgan%20said%20in%20a,unwind%20positions%20to%20reduce%20risk). A vigorous but temporary dead cat bounce (Scenario 2, ~30%) could easily occur given capitulatory sentiment​[finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vix-closes-highest-since-2020-202502849.html#:~:text=Accelerates%20finance,31%2C%20a), though without resolution of the trade war it would probably give way to another decline. A rapid full recovery (Scenario 3, ~10%) would require a dramatic positive catalyst (e.g. all-out central bank stimulus or a sudden U.S.–China truce) which, while not impossible, is not the prevalent expectation​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=Investors%20do%20not%20expect%20volatility,to%20subside%20quickly).

It’s worth noting that **1987’s crash** was ultimately short-lived (markets recovered over the next year) in part due to swift Fed action​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_\(1987\)#:~:text=,regarding%20%2098%20in%201988)– a reminder that policy can backstop markets. **2008’s crisis** took longer to resolve, as underlying economic issues persisted despite interim rallies. **2020’s collapse** turned around quickly only after unprecedented intervention. As of now in 2025, investors are **bracing for more volatility** and downside unless something shifts. As one analyst put it, “until there’s evidence of real negotiations or policy change, the market’s going to be under pressure”​[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/wall-street-fear-gauge-jumps-8-month-high-stocks-sell-off-2025-04-04/#:~:text=Investors%20do%20not%20expect%20volatility,to%20subside%20quickly). Traders should watch for key signals in the coming days: any official hints of compromise on tariffs, any Fed policy moves, and whether the VIX and credit spreads start to calm down. Those will tip the scales between a mere technical rebound and a more sustained recovery – or conversely, signal if another leg lower is starting. In the meantime, caution reigns, with a tilt toward further weakness after any short-term reprieve.
