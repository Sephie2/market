- Out of ETFs and risk-on stocks (Tech, Finance, …)
- There are multiple layers of safety away from risk-on
	- 1st Layer: Gold (if there is uncertainty, inflation, stagflation, recession)
		- Gold and Dollar going down together with Bonds: ==warning sign== that investors are moving to a stronger layer of protection
	- 2nd Layer: Bonds
		- Gold and Dollar going down vs Bonds is an ==extreme warning sign==: **Market decline can be rapid and steep**. Common mistake traders make traders make is in thinking that the market is oversold. They wait for hedging only to watch what is oversold getting more oversold
		- 03.04 VIX reached 30 by the end of the day (S&P -5% for the day).
	- 3rd layer: Defensive Stocks (Consumer Defensive, Utility)
- After a big market shock, give it 3 days of wait until things stabilize again. Don’t even think about buying anything. The market needs to show signs of proper recovery over at least 2 days so you can buy based on strategy, not on greed and assumptions
- When things are heating up, check your timeframes! Example: 
	- VIX 5 minute shows a head and shoulder (bearish pattern): ![](./attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250404125041.png)
		- (meaning calls in the market)
	- VIX 30 minute chart shows reverse head and shoulders **and** an current ABC-pattern: ![](./attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250404125147.png)
		- (meaning puts on the market)
