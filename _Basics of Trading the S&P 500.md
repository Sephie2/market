## Identifying the Market

![](./attachments/Pasted image 20250331104333.png)

- MACD crossing above the 0-line is the beginning of a bullish trend
	- the white line is the MACD, the blue line is the average
	- when the average crosses the 0 line, that is the signal
- SMA (SMA 50 → SMA 50 weeks moving average)
	- trading above the 50 weeks → bullish
	- trading below → bearish
	- SMA 200 days is also good, but 50 weeks is better

## Bullish Wave Strategy (Bull Market)

![](./attachments/Pasted image 20250331104802.png)
- You stay long, you buy calls
- You see the RSI getting overbought, you begin to hedge using put options for a week, two weeks, a month
- Use the dips as an opportunity to buy long position / calls, as long as you stay above the SMA 50w
- When there is a negative convergence in the RSI (and the MACD is moving down towards the zero line) you start selling the long positions

## Bear Wave Strategy (Bear Market)

![](./attachments/Pasted image 20250331105301.png)
- Trend of Resistance
- You short at the resistance touches, so long as we are below the zero line in the MACD & 50 week SMA
- How can you actually see the resistance trends? → 4h chart
![](./attachments/Pasted image 20250331105533.png)
- RSI becomes oversold (breaking through the lower boundaries)
- You hedge via buying calls for 1-2 weeks
- Use the peaks as an opportunity to buy short position / calls, as long as you stay below the SMA 50w

### S&P 500 E-mini Futures 1w
with Bullinger Bands
![](./attachments/Pasted image 20250331112319.png)

- MACD already below zero → Bear Wave confirmation
- Violation of the Bullinger Bands 
	- sudden Flush-down is possible
	- But the RSI shows a possibility for sudden recovery and rebound
	- Last Low in the ES1! in last Summer at 5305.75 as resistance in case of flushdown
	- Which would be a -5.4% flush in one shot, then becomes oversold

### NASDAQ 100 E-Mini Futures 1D
![](./attachments/Pasted image 20250331112841.png)
- still in bear market (MACD below zero-line and shifting down again)
