## What to invest in

Generally, using ETFs is the best investment strategy compared to single stocks, because they combine stocks over a wide spectrum of sectors and even countries, so you diversify your portfolio. That means you will never make profits like investing solely into Nvidia and see a +4000% increase over 10 years, but you also never going to loose too much eighter.
When you look at ETFs, the most common are S&P 500 Index, Vanguard FTSE All-World (which includes emerging markets and small cap), MSCI World (which does not include small cap), MSCI World Ex USA (which excludes USA). My recommendation is to keep with the S&P 500 because the American Market is _still_ the strongest. Sure you get more diversity by FTSE All-World, but the current market condition of EU countries, China, Japan etc. do not show signs of strong growth, and that was before the tariff fiasco of today.
You also don't want to go 100% into stocks, because then you get 100% exposure to market fluctuations, which is usually way too much for people. So the Bogglehead Strategy is to go ~70% Stock ETF and 30% Bonds. That can be a European Bond ETF or something like the All-World Bond ETF. The idea is that you let your portfolio grow and once (or twice) a year you rebalance. -> [https://www.justetf.com/](https://www.justetf.com/ "https://www.justetf.com/") is a great page to find out more.
Besides Stocks and Bonds, you can also consider other forms to put your money into, like Gold (ETF). I would say Bitcoin, but that is totally not true, as Bitcoin is totally trending the US market nowadays. If you want no market exposure and rather just get your money into safety and collect interest, without going fixed term for 10 years, you can go with the Xtrackers II EUR Overnight Rate Swap UCITS ETF (WKN: DBX0AN) It's really good and usually gives you more interest than your normal Bank account or call money account will give you.

If you yearn for more stability and security, you'd go **DBX0AN > Bonds > Gold > Market > Bitcoin > other Crypto**

## Rebalancing

Rebalancing means you try to bring your portfolio back into a 70/30 (or whatever ratio you planned of doing). A year of strong market growth? you sell some ETF shares and buy bonds. Market down-trend? You sell some bonds and buy more stock etf.
A common rule of thumb is to plan a 85/15 ratio until the age of 50 (for retirement planning) and shift 5% from the stocks to Bonds every 5 years. So 75/25 at age 60, 70/30 at age 65). That is what people also have seen what personal asset managers do. However, Warren Buffet recommends to use a cheap stock etf like the S&P500 and keep to a 90/10 ratio, as this is doing much better than a 70/30 ratio in the long run, even though you are exposed to more fluctuations. So it kinda assumed that you are rich enough so you can ignore those.
ETFs like the S&P 500 have an average growth rate of around 5% to 7% (depending on who you ask) per year. This includes years like 2023 and 2024 with ~30% growth, and years with strong downturns. It averages out over decades, which leads to the saying "Time in the market beats timing the market". It is a perfectly correct saying, and I totally disagree with it up to a certain point.

## Market crashes and recovery

If you look at the big US Market crashes in recent history, you will find that the crash in the 70s was really bad because it lead to a recession. Then the dot com bubble burst in 2000 and was really bad because it took 10 years for the market to fully recover.
2008 was technically really okay-ish, but only if you were holding pure S&P500 or even NASDAQ ETFs. While the market crash was very sudden and very hard, the market (S&P500) recovered after only 6 months by the end of the year!! What made this crash so bad was the housing bubble and the malicious misclassification of those housing-credit-products from like ðŸª£-tier to ðŸŒŸ-tier. And because they had such high returns and growth, literally _everyone_ had some of those in their portfolio, sometimes a large amount. And those fell to 0% with no chance of recovery. Which lead to some people loosing everything.
The COVID crisis was also very hard on the world economy and some countries still have not really recovered into strong growth. Sure, there are lots of other factors involved, but the Chinese market and the European market are also bucket-tier because of this, and the reason I prefer S&P 500 over FTSE All-World.

## The Intelligent Investor

Now we get to the most important book of all for investors, which I haven't read yet. _The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham_. He basically splits the whole market in two different conditions. Here is a very short and newb-friendly summary:
![](./attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250404210732.png)

The last ~2 years we have been in a very strong "voting machine". Everyone (stock) was a winner and ETFs had very strong growth. People were trading by hype, feelings and mania and it didn't matter. We are currently dipping our feet into the Weighting Machine. You could argue that March was part of it, but it really was just a transitory phase.
Sure, Trump and his Tariffs (and the market reaction to them) has basically moved the timing forward, but the cyclical switch from Voting Machine to Weighting Machine would have come eventually anyways. Maybe in 6-9 months without the Tariffs. Because it is somewhat cyclical and you have to take the entire market and macro-economics into account to even start understanding this properly. But luckily, we don't.
The problem with ETFs during the weighting machine (or lets call them general downtrends in the market) is that while you still have stocks that will do well, like energy, you also have a lot of duds weighing everything down, pun intended.
You would have to have a very strong understanding of each company and market sector in order to identify which companies will do particularly well, and which will do particularly badly. In fact, if you are a premium customer at Goldman Sachs, you get access to GS US L/S Stagflation bucket which tells you what to hold now. And UBS has the UBS Trump Tariff Losers Basket, which tell you exactly what to short now.

## The Charts

What we need is a Market Chart that lets us use Indicators. There are some for free, like IBKR Trading App, and I think investing.com also has one. However, the best is TradingView, but you'll probably need the Essentials subscription to get the amount of indicators needed. They do offer a 70% discount twice a year, though. I have customized my view to look like this (the orange bars are not part of the indicators):

![](./attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250404210951.png)

### Setup
- You want the standard: **MACD, SMA in the chart, RSI, VI and Volume**. The Bollinger Band (without the base line) helps me but is optional
- You want to make it looks somewhat like this, select the SPX Index in weekly view, you can also click on the 5Y at the bottom, which auto-switches to Weekly view.
- Set the SMA Length to 50, to get the **50 week SMA, which (for what we want to do) is better than the 200 day SMA**. 
- For the RSI you want the regular bullish and regular bearish charts, but you can skip the labels. Rest is default.

### Explanation
- The long-term MACD over the S&P 500 perfectly identifies the Voting Machine (MACD over the zero line) and the Weighing Machine (MACD below zero line).
- The RSI long term indicator gives us strong signals when the voting machine breaks, but not when the weighing machine does.

## How to beat the S&P 500

tl;dr: donâ€™t hold it when the market goes down. Or at least buy Put Options (/ Warrants) to reduce the impact of strong, negative market movements.

The long-term S&P 500 MACD (in the weekly charts) is above the zero line -> just put your money into your ETF and invest normally. If the MACD goes below the trend line, and the long-term RSI gives you strong bearish signals (over weeks), then pull your money out and put it in non-market things.

Obviously you have to pay taxes on the profits and in some cases this may be enough to counter this top rated 5 star strategy.

You can technically trade the weighing machine by using long term put options on the market, but then you also have to hedge using short term call options at the right _timing_. In this case you switch to the 4h view of the S&P 500 and watch the RSI for oversold (not oversold signals, oversold. the trend line breaks the lower barrier). you can watch this working in 2022, by the way:

![](./attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250404211414.png)

However, the one simple trick is to identify when to move your money of the investment ETF and when to put it in. I think starting to buy put options might be a bit too much. the only question you need to answer is if you actually safe money buy selling your ETF and then rebuying them later, and paying the taxes on the profit. But identifying the dip (somewhat) in terms of weekly view should be rather easy now.

You may want to read a bit more on what the MACD, SMA, RSI do. And what a lacking indicator instead of a leading indicator means, since they are all lacking and do. not. ever. predict the future.

After some kind of big event happened, like Trump Tariffs, do not touch the market for at least 3 days. Do not believe the dip has arrived because the RSI has a strong oversold indication. There are exceptions to the RSI, and that is the falling knife pattern, which we might possibly see now.

***3-day-rule***
> The 3 day rule applies if, say, copper crashed big then you don't buy the dip until 3 days pass. 
> If a stock pops after earnings, you don't short it or chase it until 3 days pass. -*The Maverick*

What you do? You wait for the weekly indicator (i.e. MACD) to recover and just don't touch anything.

You can keep holding your ETF and buy short-options during the weighing machine to cover for the losses in this case the short options are used as some kind of insurance and when I say options, I actually mean warrants. We are in the EU, we don't (usually) get access to actual options.
